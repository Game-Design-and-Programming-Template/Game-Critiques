# Game-Critiques

Ideas for developing critical thinking about messages in games.

* How games portray "your people":
  - Inaccurate, stereotyped, harmful portrayals.
  - Accurate, nuanced, empathetic portrayals.
  - Heros and anti-heros.
  
* Useful and not useful forms of satire.
  - South Park: Fractured
  - South Park: Stick of truth
  
Representation - are there enough of you?

Are there experiences like yours? Do you aspire to their lives and experiences?

What makes you, you?
